I understand, here's the revised Description and Acceptance Criteria for the second story:

**Creation of Tables for DSMT Files Fetching**
- **Description**: As a DSMT data maintainer, I want to create tables specifically designed for fetching DSMT files, so that I can efficiently and effectively retrieve DSMT files from the ISG Cloud.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Given the design for DSMT sourcing, when the tables specifically designed for fetching DSMT files are created, then they should be able to fetch DSMT files from the ISG Cloud effectively and efficiently.
