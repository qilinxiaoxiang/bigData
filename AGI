Ladies and Gentlemen,

Hello! I'm Mike, and today I'm thrilled to share with you something that's at the very core of our operations at Citi Bank - the CitiFTP system.

But before we dive in, let's take a moment to understand what transfer pricing is. Imagine Citi Bank as a big family with three main members - Asset units, Liability units, and Treasuries. Now, these family members need to share their resources, right? That's where transfer pricing comes in. It's like the rulebook that decides who gets what and how much. It ensures that everyone gets their fair share and that the family stays profitable. And the best part? It shields our family members from the ups and downs of interest rates.

So, who uses this rulebook? It's our family members - the treasury, the asset and liability management team, and the lending and deposit-taking units. They all rely on CitiFTP to make smart decisions and manage risks.

Now, let's talk about the value we create. CitiFTP isn't just about making profits - it's also about controlling risks. It's like having a lighthouse guiding a ship through stormy financial waters. It ensures we're not just chasing profits blindly, but also steering clear of potential risks.

Let's break it down a bit more, think of it like this:

Our CitiFTP system, that's our secret sauce. It's a sophisticated system that standardizes transfer pricing. 

What's the big deal about it? Well, it gives us a clear picture of our profitability and helps us manage risks effectively. It's like having a bird's eye view of where we're making money and where we need to be cautious.

And the cherry on top? It's our compass, guiding us towards profitable decisions and away from potential risks. It's like having a trusted advisor who helps us navigate the complex world of finance.

As for proof, since we've implemented our CitiFTP system, we've expanded its use to more countries, integrated data from over ten upstream systems, and generated feeds for more than ten downstream systems. We're processing millions of tickets and planning to cover pool transfer pricing and capital transfer pricing in the future. And yes, it also integrates the Liquidity Premium component. It's like we're building a global financial network, all connected through our CitiFTP system.

In conclusion, CitiFTP is not just a tool - it's our strategy for success. It's how we create value, manage risks, and ensure profitability. It's the backbone of our financial operations, helping us navigate the ever-changing landscape of finance. Thank you for your attention.
