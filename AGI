But before we dive in, let's simplify what transfer pricing is. Picture Citi Bank as a team playing a game. We've got our players - the Asset and Liability units, and we've got our coach - the Treasury. Now, in this game, the players need to manage their funds effectively, right? That's where transfer pricing comes in. It's like the playbook that guides how funds are distributed and managed. It ensures that every player knows their role and that the team stays profitable. And the best part? It shields our players from the ups and downs of interest rates.
So, who uses this playbook? It's our players - the asset and liability management team, and our coach - the treasury. They all rely on CitiFTP to make smart decisions and manage risks.
