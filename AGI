The framework team could have provided the general capabilities for the Scrum team with less than ten lines of code, but Ravi suggested that the framework team not do so and still require the Scrum team to create directories and grant permissions, which adds an additional burden to each Scrum team that accesses the framework. I don't see any merit in this suggestion.
