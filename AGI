Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good day! I am Mike, and today I'm excited to talk about the heart of our financial operations at Citi Bank - the CitiFTP system.

CitiFTP is our global platform that standardizes the transfer pricing treatment across our entire balance sheet. It's like the central nervous system of our bank, integrating the Liquidity Premium component and managing the cost of funds we lend to our customers. It's the tool our Global and Country Treasuries and finance teams rely on daily.

Now, let's imagine Citi Bank as a body composed of three main parts - Asset units, Liability units, and Treasuries. Our CitiFTP system is like the brain, managing the funds and their pricing to ensure Citi's profitability and insulating our business units from the risk of interest rate fluctuations. It's our shield against uncertainties and our strategy for success.

So, who uses this system? Our users are the various business units within Citi Bank, including the treasury, the asset and liability management team, and the various lending and deposit-taking units. They all rely on CitiFTP to make informed decisions and manage risks.

Now, let's talk about the value we create. Our CitiFTP system is not just about profitability - it's also about risk control. It's like a lighthouse guiding a ship, helping us navigate the choppy waters of financial markets. It ensures we're not just making profits, but we're also managing our risks effectively.

Let's break it down a bit more, think of it like this:

Our CitiFTP system, that's our feature, it's a sophisticated system that standardizes transfer pricing and integrates the Liquidity Premium component. 

What's the advantage here? Well, it gives us a clear picture of our profitability and helps us manage risks effectively. It's like having a map in a treasure hunt.

And the benefit? It's our compass, guiding us towards profitable decisions and away from potential risks. It's like having a GPS in a car, guiding us to our destination.

As for evidence, since we've implemented our CitiFTP system, we've expanded its use to more countries, integrated data from over ten upstream systems, and generated feeds for more than ten downstream systems. We're processing millions of tickets and planning to cover pool transfer pricing and capital transfer pricing in the future. It's like we're building a global financial network, all connected through our CitiFTP system.

In conclusion, our CitiFTP system is not just a tool - it's our strategy for success. It's our way of creating value, managing risks, and ensuring profitability. It's how we navigate the complex world of finance and come out on top. Thank you for your attention.
