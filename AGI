Previously, tasks were at the package level, with different packages running at different times due to varying time zones, so the issue of not supporting simultaneous execution was not prominent. However, now, tasks are at the SLG level, and tasks from different SLGs within the same package will run at the same time. Therefore, the inability to support simultaneous execution becomes a problem.
