"When designing a framework, whether a feature should be adopted is never a matter of necessity. Fundamentally, all the work done by the framework is non-essential, as the scrum team technically could do it themselves. The only concern when deciding if a feature should be incorporated into the framework is its universality. If it is universal, then it should be adopted; if not, it should not be adopted. Looking back at our current authorization feature, it is completely a universal function."
